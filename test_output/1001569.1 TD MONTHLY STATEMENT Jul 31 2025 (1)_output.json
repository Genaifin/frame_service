Please notify us immediately in case of any error\nor discrepancy. Please refer to the terms and agreements for your accounts and products for additional information. Contact\nInvestor Relations at InvestorRelations@amalgamatedbank.com with any questions.\nMARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES\nWe understand the importance in ensuring your account receives timely and accurate pricing valuation reporting.\nWe use third party\nvendors (ICE Data Services and Quodd Financial Information Services) and third-party quotation or other services to provide prices.\nThe bank makes no guarantee, express or implied, to correctness, quality, or accuracy. The marking price listed does not\nnecessarily reflect current quotes as of the statement date, as pricing services or vendors may not always provide the latest price\ninformation. Prices are given only as a general guide for indication only. They should not be construed as prices or an actionable\nvalue at which the assets could have been, or could be, bought, sold or transferred.\nThe frequency of pricing updates published to your account is based on the asset type and class. Generally, U.S. equities are\nupdated daily, U.S. fixed income are updated daily or weekly, except for municipal securities that are updated monthly. Most mutual\nfunds are daily, and investment funds vary by fund.\nASSETS HELD ELSEWHERE\nFor assets held elsewhere, outside of Amalgamated Bank, where an industry CUSIP is not available, such as private equity, real\nestate funds, hedge funds, we shall assign a dummy CUSIP, or identifier to the asset and provide line item reporting on your periodic\nstatement based upon the data provided by the official custodian, fund, or administrator of record, which provides official information\non these holdings. Amalgamated Bank shall bear no responsibility for any other custodial services other than the line item reporting\nwith respect to these assets and makes no guarantee, express or implied, to correctness, quality or accuracy regarding the data\nprovided by the official custodian, fund or administrator of record.”\nCOST BASIS\nThe cost basis where provided, as applicable, may be based on information provided by you or by a third party and we are not\nresponsible for performances and other calculations based on such information.\nUNREALIZED GAIN/LOSS\nThis information is prepared for general indicative purposes only and should not be relied on in tax preparation.
