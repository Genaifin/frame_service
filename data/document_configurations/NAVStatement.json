      "description": "Statements documents are financial reports providing a broader overview of accounts, focusing on capital accounts, end-of-period balances, and performance metrics. - These are typically comprehensive and cover capital account summaries, management fees, realized/unrealized gains or losses, and net income over specified periods. - Statements might include partner capital breakdowns, beginning and ending capital balances, contributions, withdrawals, net trading profits or losses, and realized and unrealized gains. - They often contain sections on administrative fees, management fees, incentive allocations, performance metrics, and net returns, as well as gain and loss attribution details. - The documents highlight net performance returns, rates of return, and sometimes compare new income allocations to historical figures. - Statements documents can provide additional support and context in the form of capital account schedules, commitment summaries, fee calculations, and details on investor commitments. - These documents are more analytical, including supplementary notes, performance analysis, and investor breakdowns, often showing allocation across multiple investor entities or fund components. - The emphasis is on an overall account analysis with financial implications over various periods, addressing both internal and regulatory perspectives, and sometimes providing specific notes on tax and valuation impacts.",
